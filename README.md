## Advance your subject-matter expertise

- Learn in-demand skills from university and industry experts.
- Master a subject or tool with hands-on projects.
- Develop a deep understanding of key concepts.
- Earn a career certificate from Rice University.

## Specialization - 7 course series

This Specialization covers much of the material that first-year Computer Science students take at Rice University, brought to you by the [world-class Faculty](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mcs/faculty "Rice University | Master of Computer Science Online | World-Class Faculty") who teach our [master's](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mcs "Rice University | Master of Computer Science Online") and PhD programs. Students learn sophisticated programming skills in Python from the ground up and apply these skills in building more than 20 fun projects. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone exam that allows the students to demonstrate the range of knowledge that they have acquired in the Specialization.
